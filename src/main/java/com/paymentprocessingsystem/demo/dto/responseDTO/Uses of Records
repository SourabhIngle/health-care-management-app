You should use a Record whenever you need a class that just "holds" data to pass it around. In your project, these are the best places:

DTOs: When sending data from your Controller to the Frontend (e.g., PatientDTO).

Database Results: When you query only specific columns (e.g., PatientNameAndId).

API Responses: When returning a success/error message.
